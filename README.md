# Systems Design

# What is System Design ?
 Systems Design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It involves translating user requirements into a detailed blueprint that guides the implementation phase. The goal is to create a well-organized and efficient structure that meets the intended purpose while considering factors like scalability, maintainability, and performance.

Why Learn System Design?
In any development process, be it Software or any other tech, the most important stage is Design. Without the designing phase, you cannot jump to the implementation or the testing part. The same is the case with the System as well. Systems Design not only is a vital step in the development of the system but also provides the backbone to handle exceptional scenarios because it represents the business logic of software.
From the above SDLC steps, it is clear that system design acts as a backbone because no matter how good the coding part is executed, it, later on, becomes irrelevant if the corresponding design is not good. So here we get crucial vital information as to why it is been asked in every Product Based Company.

Below are the main 5 reasons why to learn system design:

1- System Design is crucial in FAANG interviews.
